# Weight-Loss Flask API

This API will allow my [weight-loss website](https://weight.james-farrell.com) to get data from a MySQL database. It provides a simple RESTful api to interface with. Checkout the Github for the [website](https://github.com/farrej10/weight-loss-web-ui).

Docs on the how the API is used can be viewed on the [swagger page](https://weight.james-farrell.com/swagger/) where you can test the api out with a test user. If you'd like your own user account please reach out and I'll make you one.
